Factory design patter:

It is a creational design pattern used to create object without specifying the exact class of the object being created.
It provides a way to delegate the instantiate logic to subclasses or a factory class.

Use Cases:

-When there is a common interface or super class and multiple subclasses
but the exact subclass to instantiate is determined at the runtime.
-Useful when object creation logic is complex
-Useful when the class to instantiate is not known in advance.
